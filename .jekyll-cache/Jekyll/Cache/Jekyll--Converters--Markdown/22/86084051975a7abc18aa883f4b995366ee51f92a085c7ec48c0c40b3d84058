I"“<p>(<em>Minor spoilers for The Bear season 2 lie ahead</em>)</p>

<p>Episode four of season two of The Bear takes a slight detour from a Chicago family restaurant aiming to reinvent itself to a high end kitchen in the Netherlands. The Chicago shopâ€™s head chefs send their baker, Marcus, to Copenhagen to learn some new dishes from pastry chef named Luca.</p>

<p>Bright and early just before 5am after crossing an ocean, Marcus meets Luca in the kitchen and hits the ground running. The show immediately portrays Luca as a prototypical upscale chef; straight to the point in his instructions with high expectations. But what surprises me as Marcus continues to train under him is his patience and calm.</p>

<p>Now Marcus is no slouch. Last season, he established himself as one of the most creative and hardworking talents in the restaurant. He kept meticulous notes and drawings of pastry ideas in his journal while stocking the whole kitchen with breads and rolls needed for their homestyle dishes. Heâ€™s demonstrated heâ€™s more than capable of excelling in the hyper-competitive dining industry. But just because itâ€™s clear you have what it takes doesnâ€™t anyone - especially a person with power, experience to share, or both - will give you the time and space it takes to realize your potential. And yet Luca does!</p>

<p>He never yells at Marcus when he stumbles. He doesnâ€™t acost him with petty or offensive insults and slurs like JK Simmons in Whiplash. Heâ€™s stern and consistent in his instructions while also kind and helpful. Finally the two open up to each other in one of my favorite scenes of television in recent memory.</p>

<p>They ask each other how they found themselves cutting and weighing chunks of raw dough at 5 in the morning together. Luca shares that he ended up as a dishwasher for misbehaving when he was young, and fell in love with working in kitchens. He never looked back and he always felt like he was the best whevever he went, until he got a job with this other young chef. Itâ€™s heavily implied that this other young chef is Carmy (arguably the main character of the show and head of the restaurant back in Chicago) but I digress. Luca admits this other chef was the best heâ€™d ever seen. Better than Luca could ever hope to be. And Luca ultimately decided the best thing he could do for himself was try to keep up with this other chef.</p>

<p>â€œAnd did you get better?â€ Marcus asks.
â€œBetter than I ever thought I could be.â€ Iâ€™m paraphrasing here because Iâ€™m too lazy to look up the actual quote. Marcus then jokingly refers to Luca as the Scotty Pippen to this chefâ€™s Michael Jordan. â€œStill a hall of famer!â€ Marcusâ€™ path to the kitchen also took some twists and turns. He was a D3 college football player and eventually found his way into kitchens needing to make money to support his sick mother. He started at a McDonaldâ€™s and ended up at his current restaurant because he was in there for lunch a lot and the previous owner wanted to open a bakery.</p>

<p>I adored watching a black man from Chicago live out his dreams. Marcus had a whole journey centered on him and his quest to hone his craft and find his beauty. It was joyful. We donâ€™t see enough of it. I hope this episode serves as a blueprint and proof-of-concept for TV to give us more character journeys like this.</p>

<p>I love that this episode shows us how driven, highly skilled people can achieve and learn so much from each other without the bitterness and vitriol weâ€™re bred to believe needs to be part of the process. We donâ€™t have to tear each other down to build ourselves up. We donâ€™t have to sabotage those who are or may become better than us at one time or another.</p>

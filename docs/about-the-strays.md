title: About - The Strays

Whenever something catches my attention - over Twitter, reading the paper, talking with real people - I use this space to process it.  
This blog is the home for the thoughts that pop into your head, float to the back of your mind, but never quite seem to leave.  
The home of the strays.  
Enjoy!
